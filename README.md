Code Implementation for JP Morgan Assignment - Stock Market App

This is the Code which I have implmented to meed ther requirements of the J P Morgan Simple Stock Assignment.
I have created a Util Class to implement the Actions/Methods.
I have a Main/Service Class to invoke this Util Class.
One more Contants Java File has been created.

One more important point which we can implement is  - We can create a Singleton class of Main JAVA Class and thn call the methods.
That will have only instance.
